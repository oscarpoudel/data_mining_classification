# Diabetes Prediction Classification Project

This project compares three classification algorithms — **Random Forest**, **SVM**, and a **Conv1D Deep Learning** model — for predicting diabetes using a CSV dataset. The dataset includes features such as:

- Gender
- Age
- Hypertension
- Heart Disease
- Smoking History
- BMI
- HbA1c Level
- Blood Glucose Level

Each model is evaluated using **10-fold cross-validation**, and performance metrics including **Accuracy**, **TPR**, **FPR**, **FNR**, **TSS**, and **HSS** are manually calculated. The project also tracks and compares the training time of each model.
